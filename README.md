# Superstore-Sales-Insights-Dashboard-using-PowerBI
For this project I have created a Business Intelligence(BI) Dashboard with the help of PowerBI.
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It aims to provide interactive visualizations and BI capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. 

I will create Sales report/dashboard using a flat file i.e. excel file (global_superstore_2016).It contains features like orderdate, shipdate, customerId, customerName, Segment of orders, etc.All these features will help to build a dashboard which will contain insights as average delivery date, total no. of orders, top 6 loss/profit products and so on.

Steps Covered in this project:
1. Connecting Database with Power BI Desktop.
2. Analyzing the tables and relations.
3. Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
4. Developing an Interactive BI Dashboard / Report.
